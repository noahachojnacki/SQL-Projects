# SQL
This repository contains a sample of my experiences using SQL. I have used public datasets, as well as data I used to write my master's thesis.

"Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales", "Analyzing Students' Mental Health", "Querying Customer Feedback", and "Querying Hotel Operations" were projects I completed as a part of the _SQL Associate_ certification track from DataCamp.__
